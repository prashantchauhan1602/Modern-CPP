# üìö Modern C++ ‚Äì Week-by-Week Learning Repository

This repository is a structured collection of Modern C++ concepts, organized week by week. Each week focuses on specific topics, providing code examples and explanations to facilitate learning and mastery of Modern C++ features.

## üìÖ Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Introduction to Modern C++

* **Basics of Modern C++**: Understanding the evolution of C++ and the importance of Modern C++ features.
* **Type Casting**: Exploring `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`.
* **UML Diagrams**: Visual representation of class structures and relationships.
* **Lvalue and Rvalue**: Differentiating between lvalues and rvalues, and understanding their significance in resource management.([Learn C++][1])

### Week 2: Functional Programming in C++

* **Lambda Functions**: Introduction to anonymous functions and their uses.
* **Smart Pointers**: Utilizing `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr` for automatic memory management.
* **Reference Wrapper**: Using `std::reference_wrapper` to store references in containers.
* **Adapter Functions**: Creating functions that adapt other functions to match specific interfaces.

### Week 3: Advanced C++ Concepts

* **Threads**: Implementing multithreading to perform multiple operations concurrently.
* **Async Programming**: Using `std::async` to run tasks asynchronously.
* **Future**: Managing results of asynchronous operations with `std::future`.
* **Structure Binding**: Unpacking tuple-like objects into individual named variables.
* **Inheritance**: Understanding object-oriented principles in C++.
* **Variant**: Storing one of several types using `std::variant`.
* **Variadic Templates**: Creating templates that can accept any number of template parameters.([conan.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de][2], [Stack Overflow][3])

### Week 4: Mastering C++17

* **STL Algorithms**: Utilizing Standard Template Library algorithms for efficient data manipulation.
* **Modern C++17 Features**: Exploring new features introduced in C++17, such as structured bindings, `std::optional`, and parallel algorithms.([Modernes C++][4])
