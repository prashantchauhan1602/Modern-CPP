    Tips for Modern CPP :-

        1.) Everything in Modern CPP is still based on C++ 
            E.g :- Inheritance is still inheritance
                public, private, protected

        2) All versions of C++ are fully backward compatible*
            *except anything that has been removed after deprecation 
            e.g :- C++11 has a feature called auto_ptr
                Raw pointers still work !!

        3) Every feature in Modern CPP falls under two categories : 
            - Brand new addtion to the language
                a) smart pointers and lambda functions...
            - Improvement of upgrades for existing things
                a) enum class improves enums, nullptr is better than NULL

        4) If you need something, there is a good chance it is present in Modern C++

        5) Our outline has sections :-
            Week 1: Basic CPP but with Modern Syntax

            Week 2: Functional programming in C++
                        -Lambdas
                        -Higher Order functions
                        -First class Functions

            Week 3: CPP 17 and concurrency
                        -Semaphores/Mutex/Synchronous/Threads/Lockguard etc...[OS]
                        -ADT
                        -Copy ellision guarantees etc

            Week 4: STL Algorithms
                        -STL Containers (pros ans cons)
                        -Hashtable based on linear data structure
                        -Time complexity
