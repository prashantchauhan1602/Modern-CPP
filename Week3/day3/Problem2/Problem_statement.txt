Create a function that takes one number as input

    Create a function that 
        a) Allocate memory on the heap for one integer
        b) Computes square of input received and saves it in allocated space
        c) Prints the output on the console as well


Design a system  where both function run in seperate threads and use PRoducer Consumer Mechanism in it...


Solution A : 
    Only 1 thread :
        Single thread program..... ( Nonsense )

Solution B :
    Only 1 thread, member functions...

Solution C :
    Multiple thread with synchronization, finish input, then start second function.... !!! WORST 
        Because technically it is synchronized code...

Solution D:
    First thread focuses on input, second thread performs malloc,
        then waits for input to be received.
            Upon signal, computes square and display result...

    NOTE : We can allocate the memory before the number comes....
                [ because malloc takes time to allocate the space]

Solution E:
    First thread focuses on input, second thread performs malloc,
        then waits for input to be received.
            Upon signal, computes square and display result...

    NOTE : We can allocate the memory before the number comes....
                [ because malloc takes time to allocate the space]
                 
                 !! EVERYTHING IN THE CLASS....


EXPLAINATION:

    Solution A:
        start ----> input() ----> f2[ malloc, compute, square, display ] ---> end()

    Solution D:
        start -----> input() ----------------> Number received from user
                                                                        |
                                                                        |
               -----> f2 ----> [ malloc [WAIT MODE FOR INPUT] ]         |-------> [ compute , square, display ]
