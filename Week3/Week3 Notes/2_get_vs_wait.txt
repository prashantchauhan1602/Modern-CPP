get():
    Get is a blocking call. 
    When you call get() on a std::future object, 
        the calling thread will wait until the result of the asynchronous operation becomes available.

    Once the result becomes available, 
        get() returns the result (or throws an exception if the asynchronous operation resulted in an exception).

wait():
    wait() is a non-blocking call. 
    When you call wait() on a std::future object, 
        the calling thread will wait until the result of the asynchronous operation becomes available.
    
    Unlike get(), wait() does not retrieve the result. 
    It simply waits for the operation to complete.
    
    After calling wait(), you can subsequently call get() to retrieve the result, knowing that the asynchronous operation has completed.
